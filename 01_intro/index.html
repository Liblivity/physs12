<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
Here are at most 3 ideas for my final project
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1 : Speedy Shoes</h4>
<img style = "width: 20%" src=" shoes.jpg">

<p class = "margin"></p>

Inspiration: Always been fan of superheroes. Wanted to make something that can help us exceed our physical limits.

Description: Shoes that make you run very fast. Sensor at the bottom of the shoe to know when your feet will make contact with the ground, and release a piston to give you a boost. There is a switch to turn the mechanism on and off, so you don't have to deal with it if you just want to walk normally. Problems that must be addressed- 1. How do you make the shoe light enough so that the user can easily wear it? 2. How to make a small piston mechanism that can generate enough force to make a difference in a runner's performance?

<h4>Idea 2: Screenshot Mirror</h4>
<img style = "width: 20%" src ="mirror.png">
<p class = "margin"></p>

Inspiration: Many people complain that they look better in the mirror vs in photos. Wanted to address this issue.

Description: A mirror that can capture images, not really sure how to implement this. Problems that must be addressed- 1. Physics- a mirror looks different depending on which angle you look at it from. The screenshot may not look what you wanted it to look like. 2. How to create the camera mechanism- the mirror would have to act like a large lens in addition to being a mirror.

<h4>Idea 3: Math Assistant</h4>
<img style = "width: 20%" src ="math equation.avif">
<p class = "margin"></p>

Inspiration: Who doesn't like help on math?

Description: A robot that provides you helpful tips when you read it a math problem. Identifies key words to classify what type of math problem it is, and gives you advice accordingly. The robot's apperance is to be determined. Right now I am thinking of making the robot a box (kind of like Alexa), but other models may also work. Problems that must be addressed- 1. How to get the robot to understand what the user is saying. 2. How to come up with responses accordingly. Prewritten responses? Natural language processing?
