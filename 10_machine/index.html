<h3>Weeks 10-12: Machine Building</h3>

<h4>Assignment: Build a Drawing Robot. Group Members: Mazen, Canden, Helena</h4>
<p class="margin">   </p>
For this project, we wanted to be a little ambitious. We wanted to have our drawing robot take a picture, render the image, and then draw it out. This turned out to be very challenging as we struggled to even program our robot to draw simple shapes such as circles.

To take a photo for our drawing machine to draw, we used python cv2 to capture and process the image, as well as pyserial to send live serial updates to the drawing machine.
<p class="margin">   </p>
Image processing version 1:
<p class="margin">   </p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="imageprocessingv1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p class="margin">   </p>
Version 1 of image processing left a lot to desire. Although the application was able to take a photo and apply some filters to it, it was unable to convert the image into coordinates. As you can see in the video above, the coordinates only showed the border of the image rather than the actual detail. To combat this, I tried converting the image to binary instead to make it simpler to convert into coordinates, leading us to image processer #2.
<p class="margin">   </p>
Image processing version 2:
<p class="margin">   </p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="imageprocessingv2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p class="margin">   </p>
By changing the image into binary, the program successfully converted the image into coordinates that successfully captured most of the important details of the image. However, a new problem emerged with this version, which is that the lines are very rough and complex-too complex for our drawing machine to draw out. Therefore, I needed to make a third version to make the lines smoother.
<p class="margin">   </p>
Image processing version 3:
<p class="margin">   </p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="imageprocessingv3.mp4" type="video/mp4">

Finally, the program was able to find a balance between simplicity and complexity. The new coordinates generated by the program wasn't lacking detail, but also didn't contain super rough and complex lines, which was perfect for drawing. 
<p class="margin">   </p>
Now that the image processing was working for images captured directly from the webcam, we decided that the next step for the drawing machine was to allow us to import a file, have it processed, and have the machine draw it out. Basically like a file uploader. I had to make a lot of adjustments to the movement of the stepper motor, rescale the image, and add much more code in order to get the drawing machine finally working.

Reflection: When me and my group members were first assigned this assignmenet, I immediately got started on the image processing as I felt the most confident in the coding part of the project, and my team members also focused on specific aspects of the project that they thought they could do well. Looking back, I think that we could've delegated tasks more effectively so that we could work as a group, rather than just working individually and hoping that it all fits together. If I could start this project over, I would prioritize communicating with my team members. I would start the project by creating a detailed to-do list, and assign tasks to each memeber so that we had clear objectives to work towards. I would also save the more complicated features such as image processing for later, and just get a working drawing machine first. Despite the many challenges we faced, I am proud that we were able to get a working final product.
