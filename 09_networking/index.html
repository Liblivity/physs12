The basic setup is wiring a rgb led to our microcontroller, and trying to control it in different ways using our website.
<p class="margin">   </p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="radiovid1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p class="margin">   </p>
The first thing we tried was simply turning the led on and off, which we were successful in doing.
<p class="margin">   </p>
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="radiovid2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p class="margin">   </p>
The second thing we were able to do with our website was change the color of the led by manipulating the rgb values fed to the led depending on which button the user presses.

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="radiovid3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p class="margin">   </p>
The third thing we did was manipulate the brightness of the led. In the video shown, we did so by incrementing/decrementing the rgb value red.

<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src="radiovid4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
<p class="margin">   </p>
The fourth thing that we did was make it so that when you press a button it the led changes to a specific color, but the color stacks with the other colors.

Lastly, we tried to create a memory game with a color picker. The concept of the game was that using Math.random, we would generate random rgb values mapped from 0-5, and then create an array full of randomly generated rgb combinations. We would then have the led display the sequence of colors, and have the user try to memorize the colors. The user would then finally use the color picker to guess what colors were displayed, and then our program would determine whether or not they would win the game depending on how accurate they were. We weren't exactly able to get this section to work, because mapping the color picker from 0-5 instead of 0-255, and getting the neccessary outputs from the color picker were big challenges. Nonetheless, I'm proud of the fact that we were able to at least incorporate the color picker into our website.
