<h3>Week 3: Hand Tools and Fabrication</h3>

<h4>Kinetic Sculpture: Ferris Wheel/Amusement Park</h4>

The most challenging part of the assembly process was connecting my project to the motor. To do so, I needed to laser cut an additional 4 circles in order to connect the axel of the ferris wheel to the motor. Even then, some more tweaks had to be made for the motor to move my sculpture.


To calculate the current going through my circuit, I recorded the voltage going out of the power source to be 3.6 volts, and measured the reistance of the motor using a multimeter that I connected to the rest of the circuit, which was found to be 24.0 ohms. Using ohms law, I found that there was roughly 0.15 amps of current going through my sculpture. There is a slight deviation between my calculated current and the current displayed on the power source (0.1-0.2 amps), and this is probably due to the fact that the multimeter is non-ideal, and would therefore slightly affect the current of my circuit.
